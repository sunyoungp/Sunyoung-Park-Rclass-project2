# Data Folder

The folders in Data should contain all of the data used in this project. 

The `Data` is being loaded/manipulated/reshaped/saved using code from the `Code` folder. 

## Raw Data

Raw data goes in the `Raw_data` folder and do not edit it! 

Data cleaning is done in code, which archives of all of the cleaning steps.

### Data Entry Check

We found some decimal place errors in the masses. These are documented in `directory_root/Code/Processing_code/processingcode.R`

## Cleaned Data

`Processed_data` contains the cleaned version of the data. 


* `processeddata.rda` is the cleaned version of the data.
* `processeddata.csv` is the cleaned version of the data.
* `dictionary.csv` is a data dictionary for the cleaned data.
* `orig_names.csv` contains the variable names and short names.
