# Exploratory Analysis Code

This folder contains code to do some simple analysis on the processed/cleaned data.

`statistical_analysis.R` is an R script that does some simple statistical model fitting and plotting.

`exploratory_analysis.qmd` is a Quarto file that adds commentary to this analysis. The quarto file pulls in code from the R script, so that only one code file needs to be maintained.
